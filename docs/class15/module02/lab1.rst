Deploy Consul Data Center BIG-IP and Backend application
========================================================

.. code-block:: bash
   
   cd terraform/

    
Generate a random password for your F5 BIG-IP instance.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./admin-shadow.sh


Use the ``terraform.tfvars.example`` template file to create a ``terraform.tfvars`` file. 
The example file is in the terraform folder.

.. code-block:: bash

   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars


Edit file ``terraform.tfvars`` to specify a prefix for the resources being created and an IP address to access the environment once deployed.

.. code-block:: bash

   nano terraform.tfvars 

**prefix = "your-prefix"   ---> This can be your initials**

**Then Save file and come out of Nano editor by pressing Control O --> Save --> Control X**
   

Once the configuration is complete, you can deploy the infrastructure with Terraform.

First, initialize Terraform.

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform init

**Note:** If ``terraform init`` fails with Error: Failed to install provider issue the command again.

Then, use ``terraform plan`` to check the resources that are going to be created.

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform plan


You will see below 30 resources plan to be configured::

   ...

   Plan: 30 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

   ....

Finally, apply the changes.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   terraform apply -auto-approve



Now you can see below 30 resources were configured::

   ...

   Apply complete! Resources: 30 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
   
   Outputs:
  
   Consul_UI = http://3.86.229.209:8500
   F5_IP = 52.44.244.96
   F5_Password = L5l81KPsxv
   F5_UI = https://52.44.244.96:8443
   F5_Username = admin
   F5_ssh = ssh -i terraform-20210803123725302700000001.pem admin@52.44.244.96
  
   ....






- The final part of the Terraform output provides you with the information to access your infrastructure.
  You can access your Consul datacenter UI using the address specified by the ``Consul_UI`` value.
